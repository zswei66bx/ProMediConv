**Repository of "ProMediConv: Towards Proactive Conversational Mediation Agents for Multi-Party Dispute Resolution".**

### NEWS 🎉
(1) Currently, we publish test set for reference, and after camera ready stage, the full version of ProMediConv dataset and codebase will be released in this repository.

### DATA INFORMATION

We have 972 cases in total, each of which contains two types of data: `pmc_xxx.txt` and `pmc_xxx_parties_prompt.txt,` where `xxx` are `train`, `valid` or `test` (778:97:97). 

`pmc_xxx.txt`: The dialogue format data.

`pmc_xxx_parties_prompt.txt`: The role-play prompts for all involved dispute parties in all cases.

We trained our Baseline ProMediAgent on `train` dataset. For the extrinsic evalution, we build the evaluation simulation environment based on information in `test` dataset. Now we release the `pmc_test.txt` and  `pmc_test_parties_prompt.txt`for reference under `/Data` .
